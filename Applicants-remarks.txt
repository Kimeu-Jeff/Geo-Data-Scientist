# Remarks


Upon loading and viewing the given data, I noted the coordinates were in decimal degrees(WGS84). Coordinates columns in point data are labelled wrongly and were changed to long,lat. I also noted some measurements were outside the polygon area. I conducted data cleaning to change the CRS to projected utm(wgs84) that enables  interpolation. I also removed(subsetting) the points lying outside the polygon area.

On the interpolation, I used Inverse Distance weighting (IDW) for both soil pH and organic matter. The interpolated maps were visualized and saved. See OutputData folder

The SpatialPointsDataFrame was exported to postgis database using code given in block 5.
